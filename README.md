MusicVisualizer(PSV) - Project 1 EDP

    What I wanted to do - /*For this project I originally wanted to read JSON data of Steam users / games and have a way to place a circle(point) for a Steam User and by clicking games or friends in the UI the circle(point) would split up into all the games / friends the user has with an emblem of the games and their friends profile pic.  I was able to read data from the JSON file from the SteamworksAPI, however when I tried linking my steam account / other people's steam accounts, I was unable to link multiple JSON files together in order to show exactly what I wanted to show.  Because of this I switched to my second idea for this project which was a music visualizer!' */


    To start this project I looked at music visualizers already created for insparation:
