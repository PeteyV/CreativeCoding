## MusicVisualizer(PSV) - Project 1 EDP

What I wanted to do - For this project I originally wanted to read JSON data of Steam users / games and have a way 
to place a circle(point) for a Steam User and by clicking games or friends in the UI the circle(point) would split 
up into all the games / friends the user has with an emblem of the games and their friends profile pic.  I was able 
to read data from the JSON file from the SteamworksAPI, however when I tried linking my steam account / other 
people's steam accounts, I was unable to link multiple JSON files together in order to show exactly what I wanted 
to show.  Because of this I switched to my second idea for this project which was a music visualizer!

I have always loved music, but there is something about synced visuals with music that gets me going. I have always
been a fan of special affects and light shows at concerts, so I thought it was time to make one of my own.

### To start this project I looked at music visualizers already created for some insparation:

- [Entr√≥pica by Leo Zimmerman](https://vimeo.com/107184704)
- [Audio visualizer - amplitude cubes by Guilherme Gaspar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVoGCLJknes)
- [Dancing Cloud - by Denis Perevalov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLD-M-QN2S8)

### Addons Required:

- ofxTweenzor 

### How to Use:

* Add mp3 files into the bin and they will automatically be picked up in the songList.
* Space to pause the current song and left and right arrow keys browse through songList.
* Change displacement or d1 values to create different visuals!
